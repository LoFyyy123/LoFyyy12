This is a good enough injector for C ++ cheats. Open the folder, then VACInjector.sln with the help of Visual Studio 2022 (and other versions) clicks 2 times on Injector.cpp, change the Name DLL to the name of your dll (dll name in "") change the game process to the game into which you need to inject dll ... Click the cathedral, collect the solution after which we go to the Release folder and there will be our injector If they check you for cheats, they will not find anything anywhere because this injector will be called everywhere as dllhost IMPORTANT! the bottom of the assembly is 1.Debag change to Release x64 change to x86 2. To make everything work, you need the injector and the dll to be in the same folder
